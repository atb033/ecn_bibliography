First of all, I would like to thank Prof. Olivier Kermorgant for keeping an unreasonably early deadline for finding an internship, as it forced me to search for opportunities early on. I am grateful to Mr. Kim Clement, the CTO of Unmanned Systems Pvt. Ltd. for giving me an opportunity to work on a topic of my interest. 

I am thankful to the CORO program for providing me a great opportunity to learn from distinguished professors and students from diverse backgrounds, during the entire course of my masters program.

Finally I express my heartfelt gratitude to my family members whose love and guidance are always with me in all my pursuits.
