Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), especially quadrotors, have become increasingly accessible to various applications in the recent years. Currently, there is a growing interest in using fleets of quadrotors for time-critical tasks like warehouse management, drone delivery, and first response to a disaster. 

To ensure the smooth operation of such a system, it is necessary to plan collision-free paths for each robot.  This path-planning problem is very challenging as we should consider the collisions with the environment as well as other robots. Moreover, the planner should acknowledge the kinematic and dynamic constraints of the quadrotor, and be capable of generating smooth paths in real time. 

The objective of this bibliography report is to present the state-of-the-art work on path planning, with focus on multi-agent quadrotor systems. Initially, we introduce the basic path-planning methods existing in the literature. Later, these methods are extended to the more complicated single-quadrotor system. Finally, the challenges faced while dealing with multi-quadrotor systems are discussed, and a few recent works in this topic are presented. 

This study has been conducted with the aim of laying the foundation to the Master Thesis on the ``Path Planning of multiple fleets of robots using Model Predictive Control" \\\\
